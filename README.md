
```This project implements an online toy store using socket-based client-server(Part 1) and gRPC (Part 2)  architectures.```

## Steps to run:

- Install the required dependencies from the requirements.txt using 'pip install -r requirements.txt'

**Part 1:**

- Navigate inside part1 folder using 'cd src/part1'
- Run the server using the command 'python3 server.py'
- Note the host IP address after running the server
- Use the host IP addresss obtained from the server and update the 'host' variable in the client file
- Run the client using 'python3 client.py'
- Ensure that both the server and client are using the same port for communication

**Part 2:**

- Navigate inside part2 folder using 'cd src/part2'
- Run the server using 'python3 server.py'
- Use host IP address and update it in 'channel' variable in client file
- Run the client using 'python3 client.py'
- Ensure both the server and client use the same port for communication

## Work distribution:
- Both of us collaborated closely throughout the lab for all the parts. We implented all the parts of the lab together and have made equal contributions. Our joint efforts were instrumental in successfully completing all aspects of the lab.
- Specifically, Urja took the lead in preparing the evaluation document for Part 3, providing inline comments and generating output files. Additionally, Urja made valuable contributions to the design documentation, ensuring clarity and completeness.
- Meanwhile, Akhil played a key role in crafting the design documentation, outlining the system architecture and design choices effectively. Akhil also contributed significantly to the evaluation document for Part 3, providing insights and analysis based on our implementation.
- Together, we worked collaboratively to ensure the success of the lab, leveraging our complementary skills and expertise to deliver a comprehensive solution.
